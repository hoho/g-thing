g-thing
=======

Run Grunt or Gulp with one command.

Some of projects might use Grunt, others might use Gulp.

Muscle memory is a very strong thing. This utility is for all the people who
regularly type `gulp` in Grunt projects and `grunt` in Gulp projects.

Just `npm install -g g-thing` and use `g` instead of `grunt` and `gulp`.
It checks the current working directory for `gruntfile.js` or `gulpfile.js`
and runs corresponding utility.
